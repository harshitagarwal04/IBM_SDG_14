         <h4>  1. Run a campaign on the effects of plastic use on the seas and oceans.</h4>

          <h4> 2. Organize a cleanup project for rivers and oceans. Engage your whole community to clean up a local river, seaside or an ocean.</h4>

          <h4> 3. Never buy bottled water - boil, filter, chlorine, rainwater, do what you can.</h4>

          <h4> 4.  Reduce waste - much of the waste that we produce on land ends up in the oceans. </h4>

          <h4>5. Stop using plastic bags: Usage and wrong disposal of plastic is a major cause of marine pollution.</h4>

          <h4> 6.  Buy local and certified fish. You can support small-scale producers by shopping in local markets and shops.</h4>

          <h4> 7. Stay informed. Follow your local news and stay in touch with the Global Goals online or on social media.</h4>
